MFLua is a new implementation of MetaFont which is 100% compatible with MetaFont 2.718281.
It's still a proof-of-concept. For copyrights see README.orig .

You need ConTeXt MKIV (see wiki.contextgarden.net)
and a recent Linux 32 bit; there is already a mf executable available into the Work directory, 
so that it is not necessary to compile the code.
The program is not even an alpha release, so definitively don't use it in a production environment.
